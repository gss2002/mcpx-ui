## Technology Stack

  * **Vue 3**: A progressive, incrementally adoptable JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
  * **Vue Router**: The official routing library for Vue.js.
  * **Pinia**: A lightweight and intuitive state management library for Vue.js.
  * **Element Plus**: A popular Vue 3 UI component library for building rich web applications.
  * **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
  * **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development experience.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API via a `/api` proxy. In the development environment, API requests are automatically proxied to `http://localhost:8080/v0`.

-----

## Styling and Theming

The project uses **SCSS** for styling. You can customize the application's theme colors and variables in the `src/assets/styles/main.scss` file.
